# freethrow

Mathematica simulations from Dynamic Systems and Nonlinear Optimal Control.

## 1R_free_throw_combines.nb

Looks like it determines the final state of the ball as it rolls off a 1R robot arm (hand).

## 1R_free_throw.nb

Same as "combines" but animation cuts off at point of release.

## 3R_free_throw.nb

Added section that attempts full simulation.
